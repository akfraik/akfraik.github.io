Course Description
======
Through case studies and discussion-based classes, this course guides students through a metacognitive approach to (1) critical and creative thinking, (2) the nature and practice of science, (3) the rhetoric of science, and (4) the process of learning. This course will challenge students to apply the standards of critical and creative thinking in critiquing their own work and the work of others; guide students to an understanding and appreciation of the rhetoric of science; help students gain an understanding of fundamental principles of the nature and conduct of science within the life science disciplines; and encourage students to become active, engaged learners through an understanding of effective approaches to learning with an emphasis on the neurobiology of learning. Incoming freshmen admitted to the Life Sciences First Year Program (will open available seats to other FR in the spring semester section).
