Very excited to share some of the findings from the work I did in the fall of 2019/spring 2020 working with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for an internship. Working with [Dr. Krista Nichols](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/krista-nichols-phd) at the conservation biology division at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Montlake, WA, we looked at the population genetics of recovering Steelhead *Oncorhynchus mykiss* populations in the Elwha River watershed. We are finding that steelhead/rainbow (Onchorhynchus mykiss) and the diverse life histories found in this species (resident and anadromous) were genetically diverse prior to dam removal in the Elwha River. The genetic diversity that was harbored behind the dams suggests that it was important for their natural resilience, or their ability to adapt to changes such as dam building or removal. We suggest this in our published paper, but have more work coming in the near future to suggest that the upriver resident populations harbor the ability to migrate to sea and return as steelhead -- a life history that was selected against when the dams were in place. Additionally, it important to note that we see recolonization of steelhead that appear to descend from populations of O. mykiss that were both below and behind the Elwha River dams rapidly following dam removal.

Overview of Major Findings
======
In this study, we observed significant shifts in genetic structure in Oncorhynchus mykiss populations on the Elwha River within two generations following dam removal. Prior to dam removal, we observed genetic structure consistent with the findings from Winans and colleagues [6] illustrating broadly that the microsatellite and RADseq data sets similarly identified genetic structure associated with anadromous barriers including both dams and waterfalls. After dam removal, we found that genetic structure diminished after connectivity was restored. There were no significant temporal shifts in genetic diversity detected following dam removal. However, we found evidence supporting the initiation of population expansion in main stem populations after a historical bottleneck. Adult steelhead cohorts returning to the Elwha River to spawn following dam removal were primarily descendants of below-dam populations. However, out-migrating smolt cohorts had increased proportions of genetic ancestry from the above- and in-between-dam populations. The Omy5 and the GREB1L loci were associated with anadromy and adult run timing, respectively. However, the strengths of those genotypicâ€“phenotypic associations were variable and will require further investigation over time as summer-run steelhead increasingly return to the upper watershed. Although dam construction led to declines in anadromous fish abundance, our findings suggest that the dam construction did not diminish genetic variation underlying the steelhead life history form on the Elwha River.
