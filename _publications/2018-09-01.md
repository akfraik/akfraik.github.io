# Abstract
Identifying the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes is a central goal of mod-ern biology, particularly for disease‐related traits. Genome‐wide association methodsare a classical approach for identifying the genomic basis of variation in disease phe-notypes, but such analyses are particularly challenging in natural populations due tosample size difficulties. Extensive mark–recapture data, strong linkage disequilibriumand a lethal transmissible cancer make the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii)anideal model for such an association study. We used a RAD‐capture approach togenotype 624 devils at ~16,000 loci and then used association analyses to assessthe heritability of three cancer‐related phenotypes: infection case–control (wherecases were infected devils and controls were devils that were never infected), ageof first infection and survival following infection. The SNP array explained much ofthe phenotypic variance for female survival (>80%) and female case–control (>61%).We found that a few large‐effect SNPs explained much of the variance for femalesurvival (~5 SNPs explained >61% of the total variance), whereas more SNPs (~56)of smaller effect explained less of the variance for female case–control (~23% of thetotal variance). By contrast, these same SNPs did not account for a significant pro-portion of phenotypic variance in males, suggesting that the genetic bases of thesetraits and/or selection differ across sexes. Loci involved with cell adhesion and cell‐cycle regulation underlay trait variation, suggesting that the devil immune system israpidly evolving to recognize and potentially suppress cancer growth through thesepathways. Overall, our study provided necessary data for genomics‐based conserva-tion and management in Tasmanian devils.
