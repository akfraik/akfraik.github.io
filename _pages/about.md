Hi! I'm Alexandra Fraik (she/her), a Ph.D. candidate in Biology in the 
[Kelley Lab](https://labs.wsu.edu/genomes/) at [Washington State University](www.wsu.edu) in Pullman, WA. 
I'm interested in applying evolutionary and population genomics tools to conservation problems.

I have had the opportunity to work on diverse study systems throughout the course of my PhD including Steelhead (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), hydrothermal-vent shrimp (<i>Rimicaris spp.</i>), Tasmanian devils (<i>Sarcophilus harrisii</i>), and the Atlantic molly (<i>Poecilia mexicana</i>) (from left to right, top to bottom). My PhD research has primiarly focused on understanding how significant environmental stressors impact genetic variation underlying historically locally adapted populations. Here, you can find my current and previous projects, my CV and my Github website.

I am searching for a postdoctoral opportunity in the start of June 2021!
