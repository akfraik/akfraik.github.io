Roles and Responsibilities
======
Invited presentation for non-major students in the Core Science course (CORS 231) at the University of Idaho on my research on Steelhead recovery in the Elwha River watershed following removal of two dams. This lecture was given to three separate course sections and involved generating a lecture that would be recorded and taught live via zoom for three course sections. The content included both my research and the history of salmonid conservation efforts in the Elwha River watershed. The course was a flipped classroom that I also created in-class discussion questions, pre-class assignments and an exit quiz for students.
